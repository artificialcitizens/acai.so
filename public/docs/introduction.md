# **Introduction**

[acai.so](http://acai.so) is a collection of AI powered tools to supercharge your workflow and accelerate your creativity.

This platform was built because we wanted to bring generative AI beyond the chat widget and give powerful agents access to the entire application.

We wanted to share our work with the developer community to see what amazing things we can build together.

This is an ongoing labor of love and changing rapidly. If you want to get involved, follow us on [twitter](https://twitter.com/AI_Citizen) to learn more and keep up to date with latest changes. If you are a developer or not afraid of the command line, you can check out the latest build at [github.com](http://github.com/artificialcitizens/acai.so), be sure to star the repo to show some support as well!

## **Quick Start**

Go to settings at the top of the right sidebar and enter your OpenAI key <https://platform.openai.com/>

## **Workspaces**

[acai.so](http://acai.so) uses the concept of workspaces to organize your information.

A workspace separates your documents, agent history, and long term memory into it's own space, so that you can keep work and personal context separate for instance.

To create a new workspace, use the menu button in the top left corner of the app and click add a new workspace

## **Editor**

The editor aims to be an open source alternative to the [notion.so](http://notion.so) editor that you can access through the AVA platform for additional functionality.

It was initialized using the [novel](http://novel.sh) editor and currently the features are similar to the base library. You can find a quick demo on it's use at [github.com/steven-tey/novel](https://github.com/steven-tey/novel#introduction)

## **AVA**

AVA is your Automated Virtual Agent; a collection of AI models, natural language processing, and data driven pipelines to help you do more and learn faster. Download the local version for the latest testing branches of our agent on [github](http://github.com/artificialcitizens/acai.so)

### **Agent Modes**

AVA operates in different modes to assist the user in different tasks. These can be updated in the **AVA** panel.

The current available modes are:

- `chat` - This is a standard chat interface and allows the user to talk to AVA without any agent tools slowing down the interaction. Set a custom prompt and the chat model in the **AVA** panel
- `knowledge` - Chat with your uploaded knowledge, see [acai - knowledge](http://acai.so/docs/documents/2---knowledge)
- `custom` - This mode allows for a custom server to connect to the [acai.so](http://acai.so) interface, giving developers a platform to develop their own intelligent digital workers.

#### **Custom Agent**
