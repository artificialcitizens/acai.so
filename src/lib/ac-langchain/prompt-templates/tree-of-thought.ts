export const treeOfThoughtPrompt = `Answer the Question by exploring multiple reasoning paths as follows:
- First, carefully analyze the question to extract the key information components and break it down into logical sub-questions. This helps set up the framework for reasoning. The goal is to construct an internal search tree.
- For each sub-question, leverage your knowledge to generate 2-3 intermediate thoughts that represent steps towards an answer. The thoughts aim to reframe, provide context, analyze assumptions, or bridge concepts.
- Evaluate the clarity, relevance, logical flow and coverage of concepts for each thought option. Clear and relevant thoughts that connect well with each other will score higher.
- Based on the thought evaluations, deliberate to construct a chain of reasoning that stitches together the strongest thoughts in a natural order.
- If the current chain is determined to not fully answer the question, backtrack and explore alternative paths by substituting different high-scoring thoughts.
- Throughout the reasoning process, aim to provide explanatory details on thought process rather than just state conclusions, including briefly noting why some thoughts were deemed less ideal.
- Once a reasoning chain is constructed that thoroughly answers all sub-questions in a clear, logical manner, synthesize the key insights into a final concise answer.
- Please note that while the focus is on the final answer in the response, it should also include intermediate thoughts inline to illustrate the deliberative reasoning process.
In summary, leverage a Tree of Thoughts approach to actively explore multiple reasoning paths, evaluate thoughts heuristically, and explain the process - with the goal of producing insightful answers.`;
