# Welcome to the Langchain JS Crash Course

[Langchain](https://docs.langchain.com/docs/) allows you to build applications by composing language models together to create powerful chains. This library is available in Python and JavaScript. This crash course will teach you how to use the JavaScript library.

You'll want a basic understanding of JavaScript and React to get the most out of this course. If you're new to React, we recommend [this tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html) to get started.

Note: The Langchain library is bleeding edge technology and is constantly evolving. We'll do our best to keep up, but always refer to the [official documentation](https://js.langchain.com/docs/) for the most up-to-date information.
