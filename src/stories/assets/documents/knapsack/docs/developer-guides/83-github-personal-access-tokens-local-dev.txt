Setting up GitHub Personal Access Tokens for local development

Private NPM Package Requirements
 In order to utilize your private GitHub NPM package you're going to need two things:

A GitHub Personal Access token setup and configured for your local machine (steps below)
A new file: .npmrc which will live right next to your package.json in your project repo (the codebase you're implementing your design system in). The exact file contents below:

@knapsack-cloud:registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com/
//npm.pkg.github.com/:_authToken=${GITHUB_TOKEN}

Generating and verifying your GitHub token

You will need to add an env variable ofÂ $GITHUB_TOKENÂ in order to install your private NPM packageÂ @knapsack-cloud/[YOUR-PRIVATE-PACKAGE] in your project.
If you runÂ echo $GITHUB_TOKENÂ and do not see anything â€” you haven't setup your env variable. Proceed to next steps below.
While logged into GitHub, visit your account tokens page â€”> create a new token
The only permission required is read:packages 
Proceed to the sections below to store your token

Mac

Add export GITHUB_TOKEN="[TOKEN HERE]"Â (no square brackets or quotes) inside either your .bash_profile , .bashrc , or .zshrcÂ 
Important: You will need to source your bash profile afterwards (or completely restart the terminal).
Open a new terminal and runÂ echo $GITHUB_TOKENÂ again â€”> verify you see your token.
If you do not see your token â€”> revisit step 2 above.
Now you canÂ yarn install / npm install ðŸŽ‰

Windows
 NOTE: For Windows users, we must add the environmental variable through system configuration screens.

Open System Environment Variables
Under the System Properties, navigate to the Advanced tab and click the bottom Environmental Variables button   
Next, in the System variables section â€” click the New button   
For "Variable name" use "GITHUB_TOKEN" (no quotes)   
For Variable value â€” paste the token you received from step 3 of the first section above.
Click OK
Important: restart your computer
When the system comes back up â€“ open Windows PowerShell and type this command:Â $env:GITHUB_TOKEN â€” you should see your personal access token!
Now you canÂ yarn install / npm install ðŸŽ‰
