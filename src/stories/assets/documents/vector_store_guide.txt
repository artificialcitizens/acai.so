Here's a quick guide to help you pick the right vector store for your use case:

If you're after something that can just run inside your Node.js application, in-memory, without any other servers to stand up, then go for HNSWLib
If you're looking for something that can run in-memory in browser-like environments, then go for MemoryVectorStore
If you come from Python and you were looking for something similar to FAISS, pick HNSWLib
If you're looking for an open-source full-featured vector database that you can run locally in a docker container, then go for Chroma
If you're using Supabase already then look at the Supabase vector store to use the same Postgres database for your embeddings too
If you're looking for a production-ready vector store you don't have to worry about hosting yourself, then go for Pinecone
